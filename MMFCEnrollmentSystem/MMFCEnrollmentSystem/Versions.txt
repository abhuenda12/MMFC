Bug Fixes
#1 work on Eval Report . Bagamano eval report shows many subjects
  Seems it was really enrolled into 2 SECTIONS (1828,1830 )
  so workaround here is if a student has a subjectpk already listed for the sem, dont show a succeeding occurence
   
  Bagamano got enrolled to Histology 2 SYoffering, with both having same fused subject which is only 1 subjectpk = 730
  Histology SYOFFERINGS for 2011-2012, 1st Sem, syofferpks 1833 -Lec, 1834 - Lab, used 1 and same Subject PK in fused
  WORKAROUND: 
  - will create new FusedRecord for 1834, use the histology - lab for this .. which is subjectpk = 660
  BUT many students enrolled to these 2 syofferings, 1833 and 1834. both having subjects 322 and 660. 
  ===>SO THEREFORE, MODIFY the Syofferfusedsubjects records for both 1833 and 1834, modifying the subjectpk to be 322 and 660 instead of the old 730
    
#2. Almadin Curriculum Eval Report showing many subjects in First Semester..
